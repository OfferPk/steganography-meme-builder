# steganography-meme-builder
This tool hides secret messages in images using steganography. The message is embedded in the least significant bits of the image pixels, making it virtually undetectable to the naked eye.
To hide a message: Upload an image, enter your text, and click "Hide Text"
To extract a message: Upload an image with hidden text and click "Extract Text"
Higher bit modes allow more text but may slightly alter the image
For best results, use PNG images (JPEG compression may corrupt hidden data)
